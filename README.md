### MultiDict

MultiDict is a website for keeping track of words from multiple dictionaries. I can add entries consisting of words, their definitions, and their source dictionaries (if available). This format also allows me to add technical jargon from areas such as Mathematics, Computer Science, and Economics. 

Most English entries are from [Merriam-Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/), and most Chinese entries are from (https://www.zdic.net/).
